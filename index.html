<h2>Syracuse University</h2>
<p> Located in Upstate New York, Syracuse University is 1 of 15 schools in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The school is accredited by <a href="https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/syracuse-university/rankings/"> College Factual </a> for having the best Photojournalism program and other programs, such as Broadcast Journalism, Elementary Special Education, and Fashion Design in the top 10 rankings. The winter season in Syracuse can be considered extremely harsh with several feet of snow each year and temperatures that drop below zero. Location and programs are just a few things to keep in mind when considering this school, but their sports can be thrown into consideration as well. The Syracuse Orange football team went 7-5 in the 2022 season, attracting a record number of fans to their games. Their men's basketball team is coming off a rivalry win over Georgetown going into the new year. Whether you're sliding down Crouse hill during a snowstorm, celebrating a sports team win, or studying at a highly accredited program at this school, it will be nothing short of exciting.</p> </div>

<div class="viz"><iframe title="The cost of living for in-state and out-of-state students at ACC schools" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-3m8yJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3m8yJ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1408" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> </div>

<p> Taking a deeper look into the statistics above it is very evident that attending an ACC school can be pricey. Ranging from $23,000 to $78,600, going to any of these schools will cost a penny. However, there is a reason that some of the out-of-state and in-state students have to pay the same cost of living for the school. Although not listen above it is important to note that the following schools are private colleges: 
<ul>
<li>Boston College</li> 
<li>Wake Forest University</li>
<li> Syracuse University</li>
<li> Duke University</li>
<li> University of Notre Dame </li> 
<li> University of Miami </li> </ul> 

Because these schools are private, their tuition and rates tend to be significantly higher, but at the same time all students are more than likely paying the same amount to live on campus.

   <div class="viz"><iframe title="Finanical Aid Awarded to Undergraduates" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-eW9vB" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eW9vB/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1382" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> </div> 
<p> Although tuition for these schools is very high, financial aid is something important that can help with the cost of attendance. As noted in the graphic above, at almost every ACC school nearly 50% of financial aid is distributed to full-time first-time undergraduate students. Even private universities like Syracuse and Miami award over 70% of financial aid to students.</p>

  <p> Obtaining a higher education is a great thing, but certainly not needed to achieve all goals that someone may have. Some students may choose to attend a University and later decide to transfer, drop out, shorten or lengthen their study period. All of these factors can affect a Universities graduation rate. Almost all of the ACC schools have a graduation rate of over 50% in the usual 4-year program. The University of Louisville however is an exception to this. </p> </div>

        <p> All 15 Atantic Coast Conference Universities are predominantly white institutions. At nearly every school, students who do not identify as white makeup less less than 40% of the school's population. Even with such a drastic difference in numbers, clubs, classes, and jobs are just a few ways students can find a community for them.

         Arianne Dowdell, former lead of operations at Syraucse's Multicultural Advancement Office, says that schools are moving in the right direction each year as they take in more students. According to Arianne, programs set up by universities Multicultural and DEI offices bring in more students of colors. At Syracuse, the Coming Back Together event and Our Time Has Come Scholarship program are just a few ways the University is supporting and encouraging their students of color. Arianne says that outreach initiatives are often the "make or break" point in attracting students and it's important that campuses work to be welcoming and inclusive when celebrating underreprsented students on college campus. Student organization and Bias trainings are great and important ways for all students and staff to understand diveristy, equity, and inclusion.</p>

        <p> When deciding to attend an ACC school there are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration. Location, Cost, Diversity, and Finanical aid are just a few things that I've analyzed today that can be a make or break in the decision process. As campuses grown, so does the cost of attendance, but the opportunity is greater than ever!</p> </div> </div>
